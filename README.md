#### Caching
Cache mechanism implemented using `Spring Cache abstraction` and ConcurrentHashMap as cache storage.    
Spring Cache abstraction functions similarly to spring *@Transactional*, that is using `AOP` and `proxy design pattern` by default.    
Caching requires a key/value storage(e.g. redis, ehCache, ...) to populate the cache.    
Cache key is generated by appending **cache name** to *key* generated by KeyGenerator(default is *SimpleKeyGenerator*).    
Before the target method execution, cache key is calculated based on method parameters,    
then if key exists in cache storage, the corresponding value from cache is returned without method execution.    
if not, method is executed and the return type is put in the cache storage.
